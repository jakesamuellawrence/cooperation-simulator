# Hacktopia Simulation Challenge
## Background
When the vault beneath Boyd Orr was opened, new hope was sparked in the hearts of many, finally a chance to build something great for the benefit of all humanity. The elite team in charge of the simulation project soon realised humanity’s greatest weakness was their complete incapability to work together and get along. After all, that’s what ended the world in the first place. After hours of work (approximately 42 of them), this elite team eventually released Cooperation Simulator, a game of two brothers sewn together at the hip, whose only way to survive is to do so together. With hope, this game can save not just the world, but humanity itself.

## How to Play
*NOTE*: This game requires two people to play!

The aim of the game is simply to get the two brothers to the right edge of the room, through the obstacle course. One player will control GrappleBro, who’s arms can shoot out grappling hooks to swing around on the ceilings and walls. The other player will control RocketBro, who’s arms fire an impulse blast to propel you around the room. RocketBro has a lot of power but not much control, while GrappleBro can control their momentum wall but not get them any height on his own. Both players must work together to get through the obstacle course.

*NOTE*: RocketBro’s impulse blasts have a 5 second cooldown before you can use them again. This cooldown is separate for each arm.

## How to run
Simply download 'CooperationSimulator.exe' and run it

*NOTE*: This game will only run if two controllers are connected.
